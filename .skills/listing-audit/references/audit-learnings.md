# Audit Learnings — Living Document

This file is updated after every audit run. It captures patterns, false positives, new rules, and evolving thresholds so future audits get smarter over time.

## How to use this file

**Before each audit:** Read this file first. Apply any learned rules, skip known false positives, and use calibrated thresholds instead of defaults.

**After each audit:** Append new findings to the appropriate section below. Include the date, what was learned, and how it should change future audits.

## Learned Rules (patterns discovered through use)

<!-- Add entries in this format:
### YYYY-MM-DD: {short title}
**Context:** {what was being audited}
**Discovery:** {what was found}
**Rule:** {how future audits should handle this}
-->

### 2026-03-15: Script 26 bio-in-name false positives
**Context:** Name extraction from practitioner name fields
**Discovery:** Script 26 extracts bio opening sentences into first_name/last_name when the name starts with a common English word like "An" (from "An Integrative approach to...")
**Rule:** When auditing name fields, flag any `first_name` that is a common English word (a, an, the, our, we, my, i, for, at, on, in, by, to) or any `last_name` longer than 40 characters.

### 2026-03-15: Solo practitioners misclassified as centers
**Context:** User noticed practitioners with business names ending up in centers table
**Discovery:** Pipeline `classify_type()` in script 11 classifies any name containing "wellness", "holistic", "practice", "healing", "spa", "clinic" as a center. Many solo practitioners operate under business names with these words. They get ingested into centers instead of practitioners, making them invisible to practitioner search.
**Rule:** Check 11 added. Flag centers with 3+ signals: solo-practitioner modalities, personal name embedded, single photo, generic center_type (`wellness_center`), only 1 modality. Provide migration SQL to move confirmed cases. This is the highest-impact data quality issue.

### 2026-03-15: Fitness taxonomy gap
**Context:** Adding new modality across the system
**Discovery:** Modality was added to 5 hardcoded UI lists but not to the taxonomy_terms table. The new search system uses taxonomy, not the hardcoded lists.
**Rule:** When checking cross-list sync (Check 10), also verify the taxonomy_terms table in Supabase has an entry for every canonical modality. Missing taxonomy entries make modalities invisible to search even if they appear in the filter UI.

### 2026-03-15: CENTER_TYPE_LABELS in adapters.ts
**Context:** Adding fitness_center center type
**Discovery:** `CENTER_TYPE_LABELS` in `src/lib/adapters.ts` is typed as `Record<CenterRow['center_type'], string>` — adding a new center_type to the TypeScript union without adding it to this Record causes a type error that breaks the Vercel build silently.
**Rule:** When checking center_type sync, include adapters.ts CENTER_TYPE_LABELS as a required location.

## Known False Positives (skip these)

<!-- Add entries in this format:
### {pattern}
**Why it's a false positive:** {explanation}
**Skip condition:** {when to skip}
-->

### Business names in practitioner name field
**Why it's a false positive:** Many legitimate practitioners operate under a business name (e.g., "Healing Touch Massage — Kona"). The name field containing business-like words doesn't always mean it's miscategorized.
**Skip condition:** Only flag if the listing is classified as a practitioner AND the name contains LLC, Inc, Corp, or similar legal entity indicators.

## Threshold Calibration

<!-- Track how thresholds perform and adjust over time -->

| Check | Default threshold | Calibrated threshold | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bio word count | >10 words | >10 words | 2026-03-15 | Works well; most bios are either empty or 50+ words |
| Name fuzzy match | ≥85% | ≥85% | 2026-03-15 | From pipeline script 12; good balance |
| Lat bounds | 18.9–22.3 | 18.9–22.3 | 2026-03-15 | Hawaii bounding box |
| Lng bounds | -160.3 to -154.7 | -160.3 to -154.7 | 2026-03-15 | Hawaii bounding box |
