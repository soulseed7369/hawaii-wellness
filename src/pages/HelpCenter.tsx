          <p>
            Hawaiʻi Wellness is a curated online directory of holistic health and wellness
            providers across the Hawaiian Islands — including Maui, Oahu, the Big Island,
            and Kauai. We connect people seeking healing, balance, and well-being with local
            practitioners and wellness centers.
          </p>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'What kinds of practitioners and services are listed?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Our directory includes acupuncturists, massage therapists, yoga instructors,
            naturopathic doctors, energy healers, sound bath practitioners, life coaches,
            nutritionists, meditation teachers, Lomilomi practitioners, and many more. We
            also feature wellness centers and spas.
          </p>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'Is Hawaiʻi Wellness affiliated with any health providers?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            No. We are an independent directory platform operated by Hawaii Wellness LLC.
            We do not refer patients, provide medical advice, or endorse any specific
            practitioner or service. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional
            before beginning a new wellness program.

            We currently feature providers on the Big Island (Hawaiʻi), Maui, Oahu, and
            Kauai. We are continually adding listings across all islands.

        question: 'Do I need an account to browse the directory?',

          <p>
            No. The directory and articles are completely free to browse
            without creating an account. You only need an account if you are a provider
            listing your own practice.

          <p>
            Visit the <Link to="/directory" className="text-primary underline underline-offset-2">Directory</Link> page
            and use the island, city, and modality filters to narrow down results. Each
            listing includes contact details, a website link, and a booking link where
            available.
          </p>

        question: 'How do I book a session with a practitioner?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Booking is handled directly by each provider — we don't process bookings
            ourselves. Look for the "Book Now" or "Visit Website" button on a listing's
            profile page to be taken to the provider's own booking system.

        question: 'What does the Featured badge mean?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Featured listings are providers who have subscribed to our Featured tier. They
            appear prominently on island homepages and in the directory. The badge does not
            imply any endorsement or quality certification by Hawaiʻi Wellness — it is a
            paid placement.

        question: 'A listing looks outdated or incorrect. What can I do?',

            You can flag a listing for review using the "Report listing" link on any
            profile page. Our team will review and follow up with the provider. You can

            listing" link on the profile page. You'll be asked to verify your identity and
            sign in or create an account. Once claimed, you can edit all listing details

        question: 'What information should I include in my listing?',

          <p>
            At minimum: your name or practice name, island and city, services and
            modalities offered, and a way for clients to reach you (phone, email, or
            website). A clear photo and a well-written bio significantly improve your
            listing's visibility and the number of inquiries you receive.

        question: 'Can I list multiple locations or practices?',

          <p>
            Yes. Each provider account can manage multiple practitioner profiles and
            wellness center listings from a single dashboard. Each listing is managed and
            billed separately.

              <li>
                <strong>Free</strong> — A basic listing with your name, location, modalities,
                bio, and contact info. Visible in the directory and searchable by island and
                specialty.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Premium — $39/month</strong> — Everything in Free, plus the ability

        question: 'How does the Featured slot limit work?',

          <p>
            Each island has a maximum of 5 Featured slots. If all slots are filled for your
            island, you'll be placed on a waitlist and will not be charged until a slot
            opens up. You'll receive an email notification when your spot becomes available.

            Yes. You can change your plan at any time from the Billing section of your
            dashboard. Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at the end

            Log in to your dashboard and go to <strong>Billing</strong>. Click "Cancel
            subscription." Your listing will remain active at your current tier until the
            end of the billing period, then revert to the Free tier automatically. You

            Monthly subscription fees are <strong>non-refundable</strong>. If you cancel
            mid-cycle, you retain access to your paid features through the end of that
            billing period. We do not issue partial-month refunds. If you believe you were

        question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            We accept all major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express,
            Discover) through our secure payment processor, Stripe. We do not store your

        answer: (
          <p>
            If a payment fails, Stripe will automatically retry over several days. If the
            payment still cannot be collected, your account will be downgraded to the Free
            tier and your paid features (social links, Featured placement)
            will be removed until billing is resolved. Your basic listing remains visible.

            This opens the Stripe billing portal where you can update your card, view
            invoices, and manage your subscription directly.
