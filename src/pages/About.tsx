        <h2 className="mb-5 font-display text-2xl font-bold">Our Mission</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          Our goal with Hawai'i Wellness is simple: to build the most trusted and comprehensive holistic health directory in Hawai'i.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          These islands have long been a place where healing traditions meet. From lomilomi and lāʻau lapaʻau to acupuncture, functional medicine, yoga, somatic therapy, and many other practices, Hawai'i has a deep and diverse culture of healing. Yet finding the right practitioner has often depended on insider knowledge, word of mouth, or years of local connections.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          Hawai'i Wellness is here to change that.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          We are building a clear, current, and organized directory where people can explore the full spectrum of holistic health across the islands. It is a place where residents can find ongoing care, where visitors can discover meaningful wellness experiences, and where practitioners themselves can become more visible and connected.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
          We're starting here on the Big Island, and over time we'll expand across Oʻahu, Maui, Kauaʻi, and beyond — with the goal of becoming the central hub where anyone can discover the people and places dedicated to healing in Hawai'i.
