    {
      question: "What should I expect from a Lomilomi session?",
      answer: "Lomilomi is a traditional Hawaiian healing massage that incorporates spiritual and healing elements. A typical session involves rhythmic, flowing strokes using the practitioner's hands, forearms, and elbows to release tension and restore balance. Sessions usually last 60-90 minutes and leave clients feeling deeply relaxed. Many practitioners begin with a spiritual practice to honor the healing tradition.",

Hilo (east side) has a more local, traditional wellness community with practitioners deeply rooted in Hawaiian healing practices. Choose based on your location and preference for a tourist-friendly or local experience.",
