          Hawaii Wellness LLC (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) operates the Hawai&#699;i Wellness platform
          at <strong>hawaiiwellness.net</strong> (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy explains how we

          <li><strong>Payment information:</strong> billing is processed by Stripe. We do not store your credit card number on our servers. Stripe&apos;s privacy policy governs payment data.</li>

          <li><strong>Device and browser data:</strong> IP address, browser type, operating system, and device identifiers.</li>
          <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> we use cookies to maintain your session and remember preferences. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, though some features may not work correctly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use collected information to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create and manage your provider account and listings</li>
          <li>Process subscription payments through Stripe</li>
          <li>Display your business information in the public directory</li>
          <li>Send transactional emails (account confirmation, billing receipts)</li>
          <li>Respond to your questions and support requests</li>
          <li>Improve the Site&apos;s features and content</li>
          <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>

        </p>

        <h2>3. Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>We may share your information with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Supabase (database and authentication), Stripe (payments), and hosting infrastructure — only as necessary to operate the Site.</li>
          <li><strong>Public directory:</strong> if you create a provider listing, the information you enter in that listing (name, bio, location, contact info, photos) is publicly visible on the Site by design.</li>
          <li><strong>Law enforcement:</strong> when required by law, court order, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Hawaii Wellness LLC, our users, or the public.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. If you close your
          account, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within 90 days, except where
          we are required to retain it for legal or financial compliance purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures — including encryption in
          transit (HTTPS), database-level row-level security, and access controls — to protect
          your information. No method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we
          cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>

          <li><strong>Correction:</strong> update inaccurate or incomplete information through your account dashboard or by contacting us.</li>
          <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> request that we delete your account and personal data, subject to legal retention requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> unsubscribe from marketing emails at any time using the unsubscribe link in any email we send.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>

          The Site may contain links to third-party websites (practitioner websites, booking platforms,
          etc.). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites and encourage you
          to review their policies.
        </p>
